Work Allocations
----------------

First the PCB designs is to be split up into two smaller PCBs.

1. Motor Driver, Motor Control, IR coms & Power Supply Board
2. Bluetooth Coms, Image capture and Image sending via bluetooth board

For research into what components and background knowledge, everyone has been
assigned a task:
  Zac - Bluetooth
  Wim - Motor Driver and control
  Benjamin - Image Capture / Bluetooth
  Simon - MCU evaluation ( Look at various possibilities for the main MCU and
            work out which would be best and why )
  Daniel - IR coms
  Henry - Team Leader / power supply

Once we know more information, schematic design will be the next task to divide
and conquer.
